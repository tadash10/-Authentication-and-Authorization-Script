    Implement password strength requirements - The script could check the strength of passwords to ensure that they meet certain requirements, such as minimum length, complexity, and uniqueness.

    Add support for multiple 2FA methods - The script currently only supports Google Authenticator, but it could be modified to support other 2FA methods, such as SMS or email.

    Implement role-based access control - Currently, the script only distinguishes between "admin" and "user" roles, but it could be expanded to support more roles with different levels of access to the system.

    Implement user management - The script could include functionality for adding, deleting, and modifying users, as well as resetting passwords and managing 2FA settings.

    Add auditing and reporting - The script could log all user activity and generate reports on authentication attempts, access control violations, and other security events.

    Implement encryption - The script could use encryption to protect sensitive data, such as passwords and authentication tokens, from unauthorized access.

    Add support for multiple authentication sources - The script could be modified to support authentication against multiple sources, such as LDAP or OAuth providers.

    Implement session management - Currently, the script only checks for session timeouts, but it could be modified to handle multiple concurrent sessions and to terminate sessions after a certain period of inactivity.

    Add support for multi-factor authentication - In addition to 2FA, the script could support other forms of multi-factor authentication, such as biometric authentication or hardware tokens.

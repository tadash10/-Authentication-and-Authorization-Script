    Function to encrypt and decrypt user passwords
    This function can be used to encrypt user passwords before storing them in the authorized_users array. When a user enters their password, it can be decrypted and compared with the stored encrypted password to authenticate the user.

Here's an example implementation in a file called password_utils.sh:

bash

#!/bin/bash

# Function to encrypt a password using openssl
function encrypt_password {
    local password=$1
    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -salt -pass pass:mysecretpassword <<< $password
}

# Function to decrypt an encrypted password using openssl
function decrypt_password {
    local encrypted_password=$1
    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -d -salt -pass pass:mysecretpassword <<< $encrypted_password
